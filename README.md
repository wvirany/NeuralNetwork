# NeuralNetwork
A neural network class that I implemented from scratch (i.e., no external libraries except NumPy) for a presentation to the CU Boulder Undergraduate Chapter of SIAM.

The [lecture notes](Lecture.pdf) are included and the presentation can be viewed on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/tXE_exIft0A?si=WVwLTEv-pCc_6SRo).

If you have suggestions on how the implementation could be improved, or if you find any errors, please [raise an issue](https://github.com/wvirany/NeuralNetwork/issues).
